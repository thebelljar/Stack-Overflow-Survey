# Stack Overflow Survey analysis

### Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation

As a young female developer I am astounded at the number of female developers in my company. I want to investigate gender -related questions regarding the dev community across the world using the yearsly Stack Overflow survey.
Questions to be answered by the analysis:

- Which country has the most gender balance in the developer community?
- Does the job satisfaction differ amongst genders?
- What are the features most correlated with predicting the respondent's gender?



### File Descriptions

There is one iPython notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The Data folder contains the survey data used by this analysis.

### Results

1. Canada, Poland and United States had the highest 11%, 10.6% and 10.2% of Female developers respectively
2. There were no statistically significant differences in Job Satisfaction between male and female genders
3. The following variables most correlate with male gender of the developer:

  * Computer programming/ non-computer engineering undergraduate studies
  * A university degree
  * Working part time
  * Over 20 years of programming experience

4. The following variables least correlate with male gender of the developer:

  * Social/Natural sciences and business discipline undergraduate studies
  * Zero to five years of programmign experience
  * Over 20 years of coding experience in a job
